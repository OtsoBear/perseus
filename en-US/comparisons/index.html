With a host of integrations out of the box, Eleventy is an excellent choice for small websites, though Perseus' app shell and state platform make it outperform Eleventy at runtime, while enabling the development of more advanced apps that take advantage of features like request-time state generation, and incremental generation.</div></div></div><br data-hk=1.12 class="mb-1 sm:mb-8 md:mb-12"><h3 data-hk=1.13 class="text-xl underline">Perseus vs Sycamore</h3><div data-hk=1.14 class="w-full flex justify-center text-sm"><p data-hk=1.15 class=max-w-prose>Perseus is a framework that uses Sycamore to write views (the things users see), so there's not much point in comparing the two as competitors. However, Sycamore can be used without Perseus, which works perfectly well, though you'll miss out on features like inbuilt internationalization, static generation (though you could build this yourself), and incremental generation. If you want to build just a bit of your site with Rust, Sycamore is the perfect tool, Perseus is a full framework designed for building entire websites.</div></div></div></main><footer data-hk=18.0 class="w-full flex justify-center py-5 bg-black text-white"><p data-hk=18.1 class="mx-5 text-center"><span data-hk=18.2>© <a href=https://github.com/arctic-hen7 class=underline>arctic-hen7</a> 2021-2023, see license <a href=https://github.com/framesurge/perseus/blob/main/LICENSE class=underline>here</a>.</span></footer></div><div id="__perseus_popup_error"></div></body></html>
